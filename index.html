			The only crystal left to the world lies in the Kingdom of Lucis. Upon striking a peace with the garrison state of Niflheim, Lucis rejoices in having at last brought the cold war to a close. Their celebrations, however, are premature. Under the guise of amity, Niflheim dispels the anti-armament runewall and launches a full-scale invasion of the kingdom. The peaceful lives Crown Prince Noctis and his entourage once knew are consumed by the flames of war as they struggle to mount a resistance.

			Fifteen years before the events of the game, metal-clad warriors invaded Eorzea with flame-spewing weapons and colossal airships. The army came from the Garlean Empire, and it didn't take long before the mightiest of the six city-states, Ala Mhigo, fell under their force. The other city-states united their power to defend themselves, but just as fast as it had arrived, the imperial army was gone. A new era began at Eorzea, known as the "Age of Calm", which the city-states spent by building up their defenses and training their armies.
			Before, the cities had hired mercenaries for their inner wars, but now they trusted only professional soldiers, leaving the sellswords unemployed and restless. To keep them from causing harm and steer their energy into helping others instead, the city-states founded a network of adventuring guilds.

			Review:
			<br>
			<strong>9.5</strong>
			<h4>Presentation</h4>
			<p>Unbelievably gorgeous cutscenes, polished interfaces and a great story.</p>
			9
			Graphics
			Character models are excellent and some of the in-game environments are breathtaking. Occasional slowdown isn't enough to detract from the visuals overall.
			9
			Sound
			Incredibly impressive voice acting all around. Vanille's perkiness can take some getting used to, but the entire cast is great. Music is not as memorable as past Final Fantasy titles, but it's good.
			8.5
			Gameplay
			Fantastic battle system that combines frantic speed with plenty of rewards. Linear structure and lack of content outside of main quest is somewhat disappointing.
			8.5
			Lasting Appeal
			My first play through took me about 60 hours to complete. Although it's a shame there are no fun mini-games to serve as distractions, there are still plenty of side missions to enjoy.

		<p>
			Final Fantasy XI is set in the Age of Adventurers. It is the 884th year of the Crystal Era, twenty years after the end of the Crystal War that ravaged Vana'diel. The three main nations of Vana'diel, San d'Oria, Bastok and Windurst continue their struggle against the Beastmen who, although less organized, have regrouped and still terrorize the land. Rather than dispatching their own forces to deal with this threat, the nations of Vana'diel begin to employ adventurers to handle them as well as other minor tasks. The player is one such adventurer.

		<p>
			Following the exploits of the Summoner Yuna and her guardians as they battle an evil immortal enemy known as Sin, Final Fantasy X is the first title in the franchise to appear on the PlayStation 2. It's also the first game in Squaresoft's popular RPG series to feature voiceovers in addition to written text. Character expressiveness also reaches new heights with the aid of Squaresoft's "Facial Motion System", adding subtle facial expressions to characters in real-time. New side-quests include the underwater sport of Blitzball, and a monster battle arena as well as a redesigned fighting system that mixes classic Final Fantasy elements with a new "Sphere Grid" system.

		<h2>Final Fantasy IX <span class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top</a></span></h2>
		<p>
			The ninth installment in the long-running RPG series and the final for the original PlayStation, Final Fantasy IX gives fans of the franchise the nostalgic thrill of re-experiencing the visual style, gameplay elements and overall spirit of the 16-bit Final Fantasy games of the 8/16 bit eras. The main story centers on Zidane Tribal, a young thief who quickly becomes engaged in a quest to save the world, along with Vivi Ornitier, a young black mage, and Princess Garnet, heir to the throne of Alexandria. The game features detailed polygonal character models and lush pre-rendered backgrounds. They all combine for an unforgettable adventure!

			“At the forefront of a rising tide of violence brought on by Galbadia's war declaration is a SeeD cadet named Squall Leonhart. Serious to a fault, Squall has earned himself the reputation of being a lone wolf.
			A chance encounter with the free-spirited Rinoa Heartilly, however, turns his universe upside down. Having thrived on discipline, Squall finds Rinoa's carefree attitude fascinating. Yet there is no time to ponder these thoughts, for the job of dealing with the sorceress behind Galbadia's irrational hostility has fallen to SeeD and Squall.”

			“An energy manufacturing mega-company known as Shinra, Inc. is harvesting the sheer life energy of the Planet (known as the Lifestream) as a simple fossil fuel. The Lifestream is processed and made into products ranging from electricity and heat to Mako and Materia. The latter two materials can work miracles, granting the wisdom of the Ancients to the user. However, the Lifestream, like most other fuels, is finite in supply, and the Planet's lifeforce is being malevolently drained by the constant exploitation of Mako by Shinra. Though aware of the harmful effects, they function without remorse.

			However, the real battle lies not with a corporation, but a force much more competent from the distant past. A long-thought dead warrior bent on becoming a god by draining all of the Lifestream from the Planet has risen again and will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.

			Now a small rebel group emanating from the slums must quell the various dangers toward the innocent, and one mercenary for hire must look amidst the lies and deception and find the man he is within.”

			The game centers around a group of four strangers brought together by circumstance to save the Crystals that have mysteriously begun shattering one by one. The one behind the phenomenon is the villain Exdeath, as part of a plan to release himself from imprisonment and to gain the power of the Void, a realm of nothingness, which could bestow absolute power on one able to resist being absorbed by it. The four Warriors of Light turn their attentions to defeating Exdeath and stopping the Void's energies from consuming their world.

			The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies, several of whom die, become injured, or are otherwise incapacitated by an unfortunate occurrence. Final Fantasy IV introduced innovations that became staples of the Final Fantasy series and role-playing games in general. Its "Active Time Battle" system was used in five subsequent Final Fantasy games, and unlike prior games in the series, IV gave each character their own unchangeable character class.

			An earthquake opens up a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave near the village of Ur on the floating continent. Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in order to bring balance back to the world.

			The game's story centers on four youths whose parents were killed during an army invasion by the empire of Palamecia. Three of the four main characters join a rebellion against the empire, embarking on missions to gain new magic and weapons, destroy enemy superweapons, and rescue leading members of the resistance. After defeating the empire and the Emperor, the trio discovers that the fourth youth, now a dark knight, has taken the place of the previous emperor and is preparing to attack the rebellion. Upon confronting him, the Emperor reappears as a demon and prepares to destroy the world. However, the four characters agree to join forces to defeat him, and ultimately they destroy him in his demonic castle. The Game Boy Advance remake adds a bonus story after the game is completed, following several side characters who died during the game as they attempt to defeat an alternate version of the Emperor.
